    <p>Chicken Pulao is a milder yet flavorful rice dish, made with tender chicken cooked in a fragrant broth of spices and basmati rice. Unlike biryani, Chicken Pulao is lighter on spices but rich in taste, offering a comforting and aromatic meal. <br/> <strong>At I's Restaurant, our Chicken Pulao is a favorite for those who enjoy a perfectly balanced dish, combining the warmth of spices with the tenderness of chicken and the softness of fluffy rice.</strong></p>
